## 🔍 Anticipated Questions & Answers

### "How do you ensure EEG data quality?"
> "We implement multi-stage artifact rejection using ICA decomposition and real-time quality metrics. The system gracefully degrades to behavioral data when EEG quality drops."

### "What about privacy concerns?"
> "All neural data is processed locally, encrypted at rest, and anonymized for analytics. Users maintain full control and can delete their data at any time."

### "How does this scale to classrooms?"
> "Our microservices architecture with Redis caching and Docker Swarm can support 1000+ concurrent EEG streams with horizontal scaling."

### "What's the evidence for effectiveness?"
> "Research by Donchin (2013) shows 30-40% improvement when content adapts to cognitive load. Our system implements these findings in real-time."

### "What about students who don't want brain monitoring?"
> "The system works in 'behavioral mode' using interaction patterns and performance metrics. EEG is optional but provides superior personalization."
